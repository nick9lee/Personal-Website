                        <h3>Software Development Engineering Intern</h3>
                        <h5>May 2022 - August 2022</h5>
                        <p class="amazon-intern-des">I spent the summer living in Vancouver as part of the Automated Profitability Management (APM) - Supplier Contract Optimization (SCO) team where I worked on the tool known as Automated Vendor Negotiations (AVN). For a bit of background AVN is used by Amazon Vendor Managers to Negotiate with Vendors. This tool sends 1000+ emails a day, going up when annual vendor negotiations kicks off. 
                            
                        <br><br> My summer project was to design and develop a new generic/reusable email service to replace the current email implementation. After 2 weeks of design and 4 weeks of coding. I had created/implemented a new service which could send emails and collect/sort email metrics on the emails sent. 
                            
                        <br><br>Aside from code I also became a regular at Amazon's pick up soccer group (some team members were already regulars) and enjoyed what Vancouver had to offer with some new and old friends. Overall I had a great time in the city and got to work with a truly fantastic team.</p>

                        <h3>Software Developer Intern</h3>
                        <h5>May 2021 - April 2022</h5>
                        <p class="arcurve-intern-des">For my first taste of the software industry I got the chance to work at Arcurve where I spent most of my 
                            time developing a full stack web application for monitoring/visualizing/prediciting gas delivery information.
                            
                        <br><br> This project was a great introduction to industry software as it was a very mature and well 
                        thought out code base with many complex technical problems. I was also lucky enough to be paired 
                        up with two mentors who were incredible in ramping me up to the large code base.
                        
                        <br><br> Outside of the technical I also got to work on a Community Social Resposibility (CSR) project with 
                        the other interns. Our project, which we decided on as a group, was to create an orange flavored kombucha to sell to 
                        fellow Arcurvian's and friends, in which proceeds whould go towards the Calgary Women's Emergency Shelter. The orange pictured 
                        above is pip, who was our kombucha mascot. This was quite an interesting and fun experience. 
                        Over the course of the project, we were able to raise $4000+ for the shelter.
                            
                        <br><br> All in all I am incredibly glad that my first software development job was 
                        at Arcurve. Not only did I learn a ton about software, but Arcurve was incredibly supportive of my progression. 
                        If any new software developers are reading this. I highly recommend Arcurve as a place to work.

                        <h3>r/Piazza</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our team successfully developed a distributed version of r/place for our distributed systems 
                            class, creating a collaborative online canvas where users can design pixel art on a 200x200 tile grid. 
                            The main focus of this project was to prioritize replication, fault tolerance, data consistency, and synchronization. 
                            To achieve these objectives, we implemented two proxy servers, with one serving as a backup, as well as a 
                            network of three main servers with attached databases. Clients were routed to a server based on 
                            a random algorithm to optimize load balancing. <br><br>

                            Each of these servers featured automatic restart processes to enhance overall system reliability. 
                            As part of the startup process, a server would check for other live servers and copy their database 
                            to ensure up-to-date data replication. We also employed Lamport's timestamps to ensure data consistency 
                            and synchronization across all replicated databases. To create this project, we leveraged technologies 
                            such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS EC2, Socket.io, and Nginx. This robust architecture and combination 
                            of tools resulted in a highly reliable, fault-tolerant, and consistent distributed version of r/place.

                        <h3>Inline Air Permeability Inspection System</h3>
                        <p>
                            For my final year Capstone project, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team composed of two mechanical and two software engineers. 
                            We partnered with Roswell Textiles, an industry leader in nonwoven technologies and materials, to develop a prototype of an inline air 
                            permeability inspection system This new system aimed to enhance their current inspection method, which only tested a small sample of 
                            textile rolls produced, by enabling continuous testing throughout production. As a result, Roswell Textiles could provide their clients 
                            with comprehensive data on the rolls purchased, ensuring optimal performance in critical applications such as medical equipment 
                            and face masks. <br><br>

                            Our team successfully designed and developed the prototype, pictured in the top right corner. 
                            On the software side, the system architecture incorporated a RaspberryPI to read data and transmit it to an 
                            Azure function, which in turn stored the information in a CosmosDB database. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi 
                            enabled real-time data streaming to a GUI via WebSockets, as demonstrated in the accompanying video. The other 
                            images depict the Raspberry Pi with a custom circuit board and the CAD of the prototype. <br><br>

                            Working on this project was a real change of pace, going into the warehouse to manufacture this system, 
                            but overall it was a ton of fun. This served as an excellent culmination of my academic journey.
